## Project Info 
<hr> 
In this project, we analyzed the trends after CPDB (Citizens Police Database) went public and compared it with the trends before the release of CPDB. We used the following tools:
* Relational Analytics - PostgresSQL
* Visualizations - Tableau, D3.js
* Data Cleaning and Integration - Trifacta, Pandas
* Graph Analytics - Spark, NetworkX, Graph Frames
* Machine Learning and NLP - Sklearn, NLTK, Pandas, Numpy

## Dataset used 
The Citizen's police dataset can be found [here](http://invisible.institute/police-data). 

## Usage 
Each checkpoint folder contains a README document which explains about the analysis performed and instructions to reproduce the analysis. A summary of all the checkpoints can be found in the report attached with this repository.
